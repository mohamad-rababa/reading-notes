#  Html Text

**The tags used in html text are**

|The tag  | Defenition|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <h1> to <h6>     |   to write a heades    |
| <p>  |   to write the paragraphs     |
| <b>  |   to write **bold** text     |
| <i>  |   to write *ittalic* text     |
| <sub> and <sup> |   to contain characeristics that should be subscript     |


**Semantic Markup**

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages — they are known as semantic markup

# What is CSS?
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
* CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
* External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

** Why Use CSS**?

*CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.*


**Three Ways to Insert CSS**

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

# Basic javascript instructions:

*A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements *


**JavaScript Keywords**

|Keyword       | Description|
| -----------      | ----------- |
| break    |   Terminates a switch or a loop    |
| continue |    Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top    |
|Depuger   |     Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if    available) the debugging function
   |
| do, while  |   Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true
     |
| for  |     Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
   |
|function  |     Declares a function
   |
| switch |  Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
      |


**JavaScript Variables**
![Philadelphia's Magic Gardens. This place was so cool!](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/JavaScript-Variables.png)
Variable means anything that can vary and holds the data value and we can change it anytime. A variable must have a unique name. Variables in JavaScript are tanks which keeps a hold on metamorphic data. Today in this tutorial, we will learn about variables in JavaScript. We will try to understand when and how to use them. We will also take a brief look at how JavaScript variables work and the basic points you need to remember while applying them, rules associated with variables, identifiers, and keywords.

**What are JavaScript Variables?**

The word ‘variable’ means anything that can vary. Thus, the data values stored in a JavaScript variable can be changed anytime. Every programming language, be it C/C++ or Java, uses variables. We can use variables as symbolic names for values in an application.

Suppose you are shopping in a mall for some of your favorite items. You have a cart to put the items you want to buy in; this is your variable. You named it “yourCart”; this name you provided is an Identifier. You select and store everything you want in yourCart. Anything you put inside yourCart is your data. You can add or remove your data anytime you wish.

This is similar to how we deal with variables in JavaScript. JavaScript variables can store any data values (e.g., a number, a string, etc.).

# Decisions and Loops

We have learned about decision-making procedure using conditional operators in the previous lesson. In this lesson, we shall examine another kind of decision-making procedure in JavaScript, i.e looping. Looping is a procedure whereby the execution is repetitive and will only terminate until a certain condition is met. There are two types of loops, the for loop and the while loop.

![loop!](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JavaScript-for-Loop.png)

**The for Loop**

The for loop lets JavaScript executes the statements repeatedly until it meets a certain condition. The syntax is:

for (initial expression; condition expression; loop expression)
{ Statements}

**The While Loop**

The while statement allows us to control the number of times a procedure is performed. It is important to make that the repetition is not endless. The algorithm is illustrated in example 8.3. The program will produce a pop-up dialog box 8 times prompting the user to enter the marks 8 times, then it will add up the marks and show the average mark.

**Quiz**

**1. What will happen if the body of a for/in loop deletes a property that has not yet been enumerated?**

a) The property will be stored in a cache

b) The loop will not run

c) That property will not be enumerated

d) The property will be enumerated

**2. What will be the step of the interpreter in a jump statement when an exception is thrown?**

a) The interpreter stops its work

b) The interpreter throws another exception

c) The interpreter jumps to the nearest enclosing exception handler

d) The interpreter throws an error

**10. Among the keywords below, which one is not a statement?**

a) debugger

b) with

c) if

d) use strict

**9. What could be the task of the statement debugger in the following JavaScript code?**

function f(o) 

{

     if (o === undefined) debugger;

}

a) It does nothing but a simple breakpoint

b) It debugs the error in that statement and restarts the statement's execution

c) It is used as a keyword that debugs the entire program at once

d) It is used to find error in the statement
