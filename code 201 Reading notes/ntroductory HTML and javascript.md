# What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

**The global structure of an HTML document**

Here's an example of a simple HTML document:


<!DOCTYPE html>
.
<html>

.
<body>

.
<h1>My First Heading</h1>

.
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

.

</body>

.

</html>

# EXTRA Markup
 • If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser, you can add the text between <!-- and -->

 • Example: <!-- comment goes here --> 

 • What is written in the comments can be viewed if someone views the source code for the page

ID Attribute • • Every HTML element can carry the id attribute, which is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page The value of id may only begin with an underscore or a letter (not a number or any other character) No two elements on the same page should have the same value for their id attribute, otherwise the value is no longer unique When we learn CSS, the value of id attributes will be important, as they can be styled based on their id value



# HTML Layout Elements
![Html . This place was so cool!](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif "Philadelphia's Magic Gardens")

- <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
- <nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
- <section> - Defines a section in a document
- <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- <details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

# Process Design
*Process design may start with process analysis; best practices from similar organizations; process reference models from industry‐standards organizations (e.g., SCOR or eTOM) or third party consultants; or “green field” — ideas coupled with the experience and insights of the process design team. Process design focuses on defining what the organization will do to achieve its financial and other goals.*


#THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING

** How do I write a script for a web page?**

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.

- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

# Diagram Visualization With JavaScript
**For a JS developer, the ability to visualize data is just as valuable as making interactive Web pages. Especially that the two often go in pairs. As JavaScript continues to gain popularity in data visualization realm, the market is flushed with even new libraries with which to create beautiful charts for the Web.**

This post is part of a series of 3 articles about the GraphTech ecosystem. This article is the third and last part (for now). It presents the ecosystem of graph visualization software, applications and libraries. The first article listed the graph databases. The second part covered the graph analytics ecosystem.

Note: I’ve added at the bottom of this article a presentation listing 70+ graph visualization libraries, toolkits and visualizers.

The layer of graph technology that I discuss in this article is the front-end layer, the graph visualization one. The visualization of information has been the support of many types of…
