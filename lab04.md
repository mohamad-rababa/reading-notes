*JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)*

**Assignment operators**

| Shorthand operator    | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x = y     | x = y      |
| x += y	  | x = x + y       |
|x *= y        |x = x * y       |

**Arithmetic operators**

*The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Arithmetic is performed according to an order of operations*

**Control flow**

- The [control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.


-  [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp) is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

- For [example](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp), imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else.
