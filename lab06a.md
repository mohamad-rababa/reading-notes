## JavaScript Function Syntax
 JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets : {}

**The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:**
* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)

# JavaScript Operators
*Operators are used for comparing values, perform arithmetic operations, etc. For example, if we take a simple expression, 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript consists of different types of operators that are used to perform different operations.*
* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Logical Operators
