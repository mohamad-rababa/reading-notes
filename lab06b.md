## What is CSS?
*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.*

**What is CSS for?**
*CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.*

**External CSS**
*With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

*Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.*

**Internal CSS**
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

**CSS reference**
Use this CSS reference to browse an alphabetical index of all of the standard CSS properties, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, data types, functional notations and at-rules. You can also browse key CSS concepts and a list of selectors organized by type. Also included is a brief DOM-CSS / CSSOM reference.

For a beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selectors, see our guide on CSS Selectors. Be aware that any syntax error in a rule definition invalidates the entire rule. Invalid rules are ignored by the browser. Note that CSS rule definitions are entirely (ASCII) text-based, whereas DOM-CSS / CSSOM (the rule management system) is object-based
